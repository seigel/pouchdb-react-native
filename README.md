# Dormant

# NEEDS NEW OWNER

[July 24, 2023] After getting asked on when the next updates will happen, I promised that I would review over the weekend and figure out what needs to be done.  THE BEST path forward is to have someone pick it up and carry it forward.  I was keen then covid hit and changed everything.  I am not able to do it any more, even though I never really got going because of the bad timing of everything.  I had high hopes and here we are.  

Reach out if there is interest.


pouchdb-react-native
======

PouchDB, the React Native-only edition. A preset representing the PouchDB code that runs in React Native.

The `pouchdb-react-native` preset contains the version of PouchDB that is designed for React Native. In particular, it
ships with the AsyncStorage adapter as its default adapter. It also contains the replication, HTTP, and map/reduce plugins.


# USAGE
The package needs some work to get up to speed with the latest async requirements and the latest react native requirements.  I am removing the usage area until the package is more easily installed. (November 14, 2022)
