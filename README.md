NEWS
======
November 14, 2022
Progress has been mind numbingly slow.  I am currently working on getting the installation path smoother again which might introduce some breaking changes for older versions of react.  I will try and close out some of the old issues as well and get the repo cleaned up over the next few weeks.

Cheers
James

pouchdb-react-native
======

PouchDB, the React Native-only edition. A preset representing the PouchDB code that runs in React Native.

The `pouchdb-react-native` preset contains the version of PouchDB that is designed for React Native. In particular, it
ships with the AsyncStorage adapter as its default adapter. It also contains the replication, HTTP, and map/reduce plugins.


# USAGE
The package needs some work to get up to speed with the latest async requirements and the latest reqct native requirements.  I am removing the usage area until the package is more easily installed. (November 14, 2022)
